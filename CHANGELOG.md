# Changelog

## 0.5.5 — draft

- added `human-output-naming` (**hon**) module + `scripts/human_filename.py` so generated artifact / asset-manifest / media basenames use pronounceable labeled segments (e.g. `song-food_pitch-plus-8st_speed-0pct.mp3`) instead of hashy junk (`song_food-p0-00e86d.mp3`);
- extended soft writing router + `acs_prompt_inject` with filename surfaces; sibling contract `docs/HUMAN_OUTPUT_NAMING.md` / `docs/human-output-naming.json`;
- validator: `EXPECTED_MODULES` is now eight; fail closed if the filename helper API is missing when claimed; adapter smoke (helper ≥ 0.5.5) rejects classic `stem-pN-<6hex>.ext` basenames in asset-manifest paths (hash may remain an asset field);
- ACS / full adapters must re-pin to **0.5.5** and include the 8th module; do not rewrite published blob history.

## 0.5.4 — draft

- **adopter README product-only contract:** target READMEs must cover audience, problem, features, how it works, evidence for *their* claims, and a next action — not CGM, image-gen pipeline narration, or writing-methodology teaching;
- removed `image_generation_and_use` and `templates_and_guides` (and prior-work) from required README sections; added `adopter_readme_policy` anti-rules to `templates/readme-contract.json` + schema;
- updated playbook, writing-direction, README template, AGENTS human-facing gate, and IMAGE_GUIDE audience note so image provenance stays in `.content-system/asset-manifest` (or linked records);
- optional deterministic adapter guard (helper ≥ 0.5.4): forbid `content-generation-modules` / `CGM` and the exact `## Image generation and use` heading in adopter README when `--adapter` is used;
- helper README may still document CGM, images, and templates (that is this product). Soft/docs+contract only — no prose NLP CI gate.


## 0.5.3 — draft

- soft writing router now **includes commit messages and commit subjects** → `human-sounding-writing` (**hsw**); README/product entry stays on `writing-direction`;
- contract language strengthened to **MUST load / APPLY** (`application: must_load`, per-route `required_load: true`, `apply_checklist`); no longer "prefer" or "outside the soft router" for commits;
- added machine-readable `acs_prompt_inject` so ACS can inject the MUST-load contract into agent prompts on hotload (documented in `docs/ACS_VERIFY.md`);
- validator checks commit surfaces, `required_load`, `apply_checklist`, and `acs_prompt_inject`; still no prose-style NLP CI gate.


## 0.5.2 — draft

- expanded soft writing router so PR titles/bodies, issue titles/bodies, issue-log titles, non-README docs, and changelog prose load `human-sounding-writing` (**hsw**); README/product entry stays on `writing-direction`;
- added machine-readable soft router `docs/writing-routing.json` (`content-generation.writing-routing.v1`) checked by the validator;
- added ACS hotload verify entrypoint: `python scripts/validate_content_system.py --root <cgm> --mode writing` emits a stable `CGM_VERIFY` line; documented for ACS in `docs/ACS_VERIFY.md`;
- no prose-style CI gate — presence + agent discipline only.

## 0.5.1 — draft

- documented official short name **hsw** (also HSW) for the `human-sounding-writing` module in the skill frontmatter/body, soft writing router, AGENTS, README, and human-sounding guide;
- canonical module id, folder name, and `EXPECTED_MODULES` entry remain `human-sounding-writing` (adapters keep that id);
- rebuilt root README for ACS / Study-os pin path: current version near the top, seven-module catalog with paths and when-to-load, writing-router summary + hsw alias, adapter pin instructions (version/SHA, `.content-system/`, validator), tightened story while keeping required sections and marketing assets;
- docs/alias + README contract refresh — no module rename or router behavior change beyond naming the short alias.

## 0.5.0 — draft

- added the `human-sounding-writing` module for posts, blogs, social copy, general agent prose, and papers or data writeups;
- vendored `docs/HUMAN_SOUNDING_WRITING.md` and `docs/human-sounding-rules.json` so adapters do not depend on box-only shared refs;
- added soft writing router `docs/WRITING_ROUTING.md` so README/product entry keeps `writing-direction` scan/bold rules while other prose uses human-sounding guidance;
- updated `AGENTS.md` and README module-selection guidance to point at the router;
- treated the new required module as a breaking helper contract and versioned the helper from `0.4.0` to `0.5.0`;
- added `docs/MIGRATING_TO_0.5.md` so adapters add `human-sounding-writing` to their modules list and bump the pin.


## 0.3.1 — draft

- added a deterministic `0.3.x` narrative-image gate that rejects SVG substitutions, missing built-in image-generation provenance, missing exact title/subtitle records, missing prompt records, and stale file hashes;
- added `docs/HOLDOUT_EVALUATION.md` with a private three-run protocol for testing whether an agent repeats the contract on unseen target repositories;
- updated the visual template, README contract, migration guide, and helper version to make the generation workflow and holdout path durable.

## 0.3.0 — draft

- recorded the UX, accessibility, and marketing research behind descriptive headings, short sections, bullets, and selective bolding in `docs/CONTENT_RESEARCH.md`;
- made the heading-and-bold second-story scan test part of the README template, playbook, writing module, machine-readable contract, and validator;
- added `docs/BRAND_DIRECTION.md` with the Story Loop direction and analysis of prior anime-inspired README work in Harness on Steroids and Eval Lab;
- replaced the paper-study marketing visuals with original anime-inspired content UX assets showing a content designer, story-guide companion, and research-to-review loop;
- recorded the new image prompts, exact copy, alt text, crop behavior, rejection conditions, and review decisions;
- added migration guidance for existing `0.2.x` target repositories;
- versioned the helper contract from `0.2.0` to `0.3.0`.

## 0.2.0 — draft

- made the README a human-facing product entry point with a required situation, consequence, product promise, mechanism, evidence, boundaries, and next action;
- added a machine-readable README contract and deterministic checks for required sections, local visual assets, image guides, templates, and prior-work references;
- replaced the minimal README starter with a welcoming, visual, evidence-bounded template;
- added the README playbook, image generation and use guide, and prior-work record from Eval Lab, Harness on steroids, Custom Extensions, and Hades Product;
- added migration guidance for existing `0.1.x` target repositories;
- added an operational handoff gate so technical-only README drafts cannot pass as complete human-facing work;
- versioned the helper contract from `0.1.2` to `0.2.0`.

## 0.1.0 — draft

- established the six-module helper contract;
- added project, asset, and review schemas;
- added target-repository templates;
- added dependency-free structural validation;
- added ChatGPT Project/custom-GPT setup guidance;
- documented human-first writing, visual continuity, and image-generation metadata.

## 0.1.1 — draft

- added deterministic validation for a target repository adapter;
- added project-root asset existence checks when validating an adapter.

## 0.1.2 — draft

- made a short, exact title plus subtitle the default for narrative raster assets;
- kept icons, SVGs, logos, and tiny helper graphics text-free by default;
- added rejection guidance for garbled, crowded, or overlong generated copy;
- updated image-brief and visual-style templates so future adapters inherit the rule.
